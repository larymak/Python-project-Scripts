## Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and Pygame. The game starts with a single snake that you control using arrow keys or WASD keys. Your goal is to eat the brown squares (food) to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the game boundaries and the snake's own body. The game ends if you run into a wall or collide with yourself.
