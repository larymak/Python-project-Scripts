# Tic Tac Toe with ttkbootstrap and pygame

Simple and good looking tic tac toe game including sound. The game is only for 2 player, sadly I am not ready
enough to add the AI boot (I don't want to add the random boot :) )

## Description

The game is made only in ttkboostrap and some little pygame for the sound. You can customize this game as you
want. The main thing you can do is to change the color and many things. To see them check the OPTION part.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to
install [ttkboostrap](https://ttkbootstrap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the [pygame ](https://www.pygame.org/news)

```bash
pip install ttkboostrap
```

```bash
pip install pygame 
```

## Option

The configuration.py file is made in that the information is stored in dictionary/hash-map or like json file.
In this way is very easy to change the color, the font and kind of everthing you want :/ (so be carefull)
