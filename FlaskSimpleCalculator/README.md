# SIMPLE FLASK CALCULATOR

I have created a simple flask calculator in which user can give two operands and choose one operator to be applied on these operands and the calculated output is shown in simple result page.

The values of operands are taken through a HTML form.

All HTML files are present in templates and the main flask app is present in app.py.
